# Welcome to the garage! 👋🏻

**Mechatronics Engineering Student | Computer Science graduate**

I’m learning how code, mechanics, and electronics can work together to solve real problems. Most of what I build starts as an experiment — something small that teaches me a bit more about how systems think and behave.

Lately, I’ve been drawn to how engineering principles show up in biomedical tech and Formula 1 — two worlds where precision, timing, and iteration define everything.

### I build, test, break, and rebuild — that’s where the fun is. 🌱 

I keep exploring ways to write cleaner code and design smarter systems, one project at a time.
