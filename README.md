# Hello everyone! 👋🏻

**Bachelor of Computer Science · Mechatronics Engineering Student**

Driven by curiosity — exploring how strong computer science principles can shape real engineering work.
I’m still learning, building, and refining my craft — and I share what I discover along the way.

###  Learning, building, daring — the only way to create lasting change 🌱

I believe that understanding the “why” behind systems leads to simpler, more thoughtful solutions.
I’m drawn to scalable back-end design and minimalist algorithms like streaming and probabilistic structures.
