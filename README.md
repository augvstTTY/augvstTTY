# Welcome to the garage 👋🏻  

### Built by curiosity  

I’m a **Mechatronics Engineering student** and **Computer Science graduate** —  
exploring where code, motion, and design meet in precision.  

---

### Build. Learn. Refine. Repeat.  

Fascinated by the discipline of **Formula 1** and the purpose behind **biomedical tech** —  both remind me that progress lives in the details.
