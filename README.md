# Welcome to the garage! 👋🏻

### 💡 Curiosity keeps me moving.

I’m a Mechatronics engineering student and a Computer Science graduate,
exploring how code, mechanics, and motion align.

---

### 🏁 I build, I fail, I learn — and I refine.


I'm drawn to the precision of Formula 1 and biomedical tech —
both chasing perfection through micrometers and milliseconds.
