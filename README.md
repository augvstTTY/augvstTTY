# Hello everyone! 👋🏻

**Bachelor of Computer Science · Mechatronics Engineering Student**

Driven by curiosity — exploring how solid computer science foundations can solve real engineering challenges.
I enjoy learning in public, building with intention, and sharing what I discover along the way.

###  Learning, building, daring — the only way to create lasting change 🌱

I believe understanding the “why” behind systems leads to simpler, more enduring solutions.
My work spans from scalable back-end architectures to minimalist algorithms like streaming and probabilistic data structures.
