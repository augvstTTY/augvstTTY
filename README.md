# Welcome to the garage 👋🏻  

### Built by curiosity  

I’m a Mechatronics Engineering student and Computer Science graduate,
exploring how code, motion, and design evolve through constant refinement.
Inspired by the precision of Formula 1 and the purpose behind biomedical tech,
I believe progress is built one iteration at a time.

(Silence speaks after good work.)
