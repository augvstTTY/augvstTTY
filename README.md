# Welcome to the garage! 👋🏻

**Mechatronics Engineering Student | Computer Science graduate**

I’m exploring how code, mechanics, and electronics come together to solve real problems. Most of what I build starts as an experiment — something small that helps me understand how systems think, move, and fail.

Lately, I’ve been fascinated by how engineering principles power biomedical tech and Formula 1 — two fields where precision, timing, and iteration make all the difference.

### I build, test, break, and rebuild — it’s the only way to create lasting change. 🌱

Always learning, always trying to write cleaner code and design smarter systems — one project at a time.
