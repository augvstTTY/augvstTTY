# Welcome to the garage 👋🏻  

### 💡 Curiosity keeps me moving  

I’m a Mechatronics engineering student and a Computer Science graduate.  
Exploring how code, mechanics, and motion come alive together.

### 🏁 I build. I fail. I learn. I refine.  

Drawn to the precision of Formula 1 and biomedical tech —  
both chasing perfection through micrometers and milliseconds.  

> “I haven’t failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that don’t work.”  
> **— Thomas A. Edison**
