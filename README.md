# Welcome to the garage! 👋🏻

**Mechatronics Engineering Student | Computer Science graduate**

I’m exploring how code, mechanics, and electronics converge to solve real problems. Most of what I build starts as a small experiment—helping me grasp how systems think, move, and fail, often iterating until failure rates drop below 5%.

I study how engineering principles drive biomedical tech and Formula 1—fields where precision reaches μm-scale (e.g., surgical robotics), timing demands <1ms (e.g., F1 engine control), and rapid iteration (100+ cycles per race weekend) defines success.

### I build, test, fail,, and rebuild — It's the only way to bring about change. 🌱

Always learning: cleaner code, precise systems—one project at a time.
