# Hello everyone! 👋🏻

**Bachelor of Computer Science · Mechatronics Engineering**

I am passionate about building efficient and scalable back-end systems and network infrastructure. My interest lies in solving practical data-intensive problems—like traffic analysis or large-scale data processing—using minimalist and efficient algorithmic solutions (e.g., streaming algorithms and probabilistic data structures).

I am driven by a strong commitment to knowledge sharing and applying rigorous computer science theory to real-world engineering challenges.
