# Hello everyone! 👋🏻

**Bachelor of Computer Science · Mechatronics Engineering Student**

On a path from learning rigorous foundations to applying elegant solutions. I'm passionate about building scalable back-end systems and tackling data-intensive problems through minimalist algorithms like streaming and probabilistic data structures.

### Applied Rigor

I am driven by a strong commitment to knowledge sharing and applying rigorous computer science theory to real-world engineering challenges.
