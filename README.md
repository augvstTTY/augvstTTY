# Hello everyone! 👋🏻

**Bachelor of Computer Science · Mechatronics Engineering Student**

On a path from learning rigorous foundations to applying elegant solutions. I'm passionate about building scalable back-end systems and tackling data-intensive problems through minimalist algorithms like streaming and probabilistic data structures.

### Learning in Public, Building with Rigor

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and grounding my work in fundamental CS principles to solve tangible engineering challenges.
