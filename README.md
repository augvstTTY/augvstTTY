# Welcome to the garage 👋🏻  

### Curiosity built this place  

I’m a Mechatronics Engineering student and Computer Science graduate —  
always exploring how code, motion, and design can move in harmony.

### Build. Learn. Refine. Repeat.  

Fascinated by the precision of Formula 1 and the purpose of biomedical tech —  
both remind me that progress lives in the details.
