### Mechatronics Engineering Student | Computer Science graduate

**Building curiosity into every system.**

I’m exploring how code, mechanics, and electronics come together to solve real problems.
Most of what I build begins as a small experiment — a hands-on way to understand how systems think, move, and fail.

I keep iterating, often failing first, to push error rates below 5%.

**Where precision meets motion.**

I’m drawn to the engineering principles behind biomedical tech and Formula 1 — worlds where:

- Precision reaches the μm scale (like in surgical robotics)

- Timing demands < 1 ms (as in F1 engine control)

- Success depends on rapid iteration, sometimes 100+ times per race weekend
