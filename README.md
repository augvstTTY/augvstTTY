# Hello everyone! 👋🏻

**Bachelor of Computer Science · Mechatronics Engineering Student**

I’m driven by curiosity — exploring how solid computer science foundations can solve real engineering challenges.  
I enjoy learning in public, building with intention, and sharing what I discover along the way.

###  Learning with Purpose · Building with Curiosity

I believe that understanding the “why” behind systems leads to better, simpler solutions.  
My interests span from scalable back-end architectures to minimalist algorithms like streaming and probabilistic data structures.
