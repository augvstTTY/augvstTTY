**Curiosity in motion.**

Exploring how code, mechanics, and electronics come alive together.  
Building, failing, learning — always improving.

**Where precision meets motion.**

I’m fascinated by how Formula 1 and biomedical tech chase perfection —  
down to micrometers, milliseconds, and endless iterations.
