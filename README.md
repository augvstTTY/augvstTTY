# Welcome to the garage! 👋🏻

**Mechatronics Engineering Student | Computer Science graduate**

Applying computational thinking and robust software practices to solve tangible engineering challenges. I'm currently building my skills in mechatronics and sharing key insights from the intersection of code and hardware

### Learning, building, and tackling complex problems — my framework for creating robust systems. 🌱 

That's why I'm focused on scalable back-end design and efficient algorithms, from streaming models to probabilistic data structures.
