### Mechatronics Engineering Student | Computer Science graduate

**Building curiosity into every system.**

I’m learning how code, mechanics, and electronics connect to create things that actually work.
Most of what I build starts as a small experiment — a way to test ideas, see how systems react, and understand why they fail before they don’t.

I keep iterating, trying, and fixing — chasing that moment when the numbers finally make sense.

**Where precision meets motion.**

I’m especially interested in the engineering behind biomedical tech and Formula 1 — places where:

- Precision reaches the micrometer scale (like in surgical robotics)

- Timing has to be faster than a blink (under 1 ms in F1 control systems)

- Progress comes from constant iteration — sometimes 100+ tweaks per race weekend
